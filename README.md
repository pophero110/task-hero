## Component-Based Architecture

### Key Principles of Component-Based Architecture (CBA):

Modularity – Each component encapsulates specific functionality (e.g., rendering, movement).
Reusability – Components can be reused across different game objects.
Separation of Concerns – Logic is divided into focused components (e.g., physics vs. input).
Composability – Complex behaviors arise from combining simple components.
Encapsulation – Components hide internal state/logic and expose a simple interface.
